Notable artifact (developer-friendly demo)

Embed a tiny sample (illustrative) showing how the MatchAgent picks providers:

// MatchAgent demo (illustrative)
class MatchAgent {
  constructor(providers) { this.providers = providers; }
  score(request, provider) {
    // simple score: rating * availability * distanceFactor
    return provider.rating * (provider.available ? 1 : 0.5) * (1 / (1 + provider.distanceKm));
  }
  findBest(request) {
    return this.providers
      .map(p => ({ p, score: this.score(request, p) }))
      .sort((a,b) => b.score - a.score)[0].p;
  }
}
